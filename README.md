# thesis-project-final
This is an independent research project to investigate the implications of sports betting on player performance. The guiding question for this project is as follows: 'If a player knows spectators are betting on their performance, does that impact their performance?'. This project is focused on Major League Baseball, but there are hopes of it being translated to other major league sports teams in the future. The project will incorporate SQL and R primarly to handle web scraping, exploratory data analysis, database creation and management, and model production. The estimated completion date for this project is Winter 2025.
