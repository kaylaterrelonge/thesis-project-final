# thesis-project-final

This is an independent research project to investigate the implications of sports betting on player performance in Major League Baseball (MLB). The research question for this project is as follows:  “Has the Widespread Legalization of Sports Betting in the United States influenced player performance in Major League Baseball?”. The project utilizes R to conduct a time-series analysis on historical MLB player data from 2000 to 2023. Web-scrapping techniques, function building, exploratory data analysis, and statistical testing were used to assist in answering the posed question. In the following github, you will find all of the code created to generate the results found in the the thesis. The thesis will be submitted in Spring 2025.
